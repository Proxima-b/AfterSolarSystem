			description = The star is dying. The hydrogen in the center has already been burned out, leaving only the core composed of carbon and helium. Before that, it had ended the RGB phase. After the helium flash, it entered the horizontal branch and then the asymptotic giant branch; The last energy before death supported its shell and pushed its atmosphere to expand, making the sun more than 2800 times brighter than before and becoming a giant. Mercury and Venus have been swallowed up, and the earth will be the same fate as them in the future; At the same time, the mass of the sun is slowly decreasing, and the orbits of the surviving celestial bodies are gradually moving outward. Even so, the huge heat brought by the fusion energy still causes the surface temperature of any celestial body within the orbit of Uranus to rise to the extent that carbon based life cannot survive, while the light intensity in the orbit of distant Neptune is just right......
