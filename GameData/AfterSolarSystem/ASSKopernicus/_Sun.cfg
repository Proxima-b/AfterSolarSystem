			description = The star is dying, the hydrogen in its core has been burned out, and the fusion reaction is no longer strong enough to resist gravity. At the same time, the helium core produced by the previous fusion is heated by gravity, the hydrogen layer shrinks, and the fusion of hydrogen accelerates, producing more energy, causing the sun to be more than 2,800 times brighter than before and expanding its volume. Helium fusion kicks in when its core continues to shrink to the density and temperature conditions required to ignite the 3-helium process. It was more than 230 times larger than before, and engulfed Mercury and Venus in the solar system. At the same time, its mass is also slowly losing, and the orbits of the surviving celestial bodies are also slowly moving outward. Even so, the huge heat radiated by the sun also causes the temperature of any celestial body within the orbit of Neptune to rise to the point where life cannot be existing temperature. So much so that on distant Pluto, the temperature has risen to a temperature where life can survive......
