			description =  2012 VP113, also known by its nickname "Biden", is a trans-Neptunian object of the sednoid population, located in the outermost reaches of the Solar System. It was first observed on 5 November 2012 by American astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.The discovery was announced on 26 March 2014.The object probably measures somewhere between 300 and 1000 km in diameter, possibly large enough to be a dwarf planet.2012 VP113 has the largest perihelion distance of any known object in the Solar System. Its last perihelion was within a couple months of September 1979.The paucity of bodies with perihelia at 50–75 AU appears not to be an observational artifact. It is possibly a member of a hypothesized Hills cloud. It has a perihelion, argument of perihelion, and current position in the sky similar to those of Sedna.In fact, all known Solar System bodies with semi-major axes over 150 AU and perihelia greater than Neptune's have arguments of perihelion clustered near 340°±55°.This could indicate a similar formation mechanism for these bodies.(148209) 2000 CR105 was the first such object discovered. It is currently unknown how 2012 VP113 acquired a perihelion distance beyond the Kuiper belt. The characteristics of its orbit, like those of Sedna's, have been explained as possibly created by a passing star or a trans-Neptunian planet of several Earth masses hundreds of astronomical units from the Sun.The orbital architecture of the trans-Plutonian region may signal the presence of more than one planet.2012 VP113 could even be captured from another planetary system.However, it is considered more likely that the perihelion of 2012 VP113 was raised by multiple interactions within the crowded confines of the open star cluster in which the Sun formed.
