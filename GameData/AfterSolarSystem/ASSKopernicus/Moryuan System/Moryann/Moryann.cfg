			description = Moryann is a gaseous planet that is much larger than Jupiter in our solar system and is bluish in color. It has a huge storm in its northern hemisphere, which is much larger than the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. This huge blue storm occupies 1/3 of Moryann's diameter. This storm has raged on Moryann for thousands of years. There is still no sign of disappearing or decreasing. At the same time, Moryann is in the system's habitable zone, which is one of the anomalies in this star system. All the gaseous planets in this system are too close to the star, while the rocky planets are very close to the star. This shows that all the gas planets in this system are migrating inward, and the migration also causes the rocky planets to continue to approach the parent star along with the gas planets. Eventually, some of the rocky planets either fell into the star under the gravitational pull of another star, or were thrown out of the system.  In addition, it also has a huge and thin halo, which may have been formed tens of thousands of years ago when a large moon entered its Roche limit. We speculate that a rocky planet may have been captured during the inward migration of Moryann after its formation. This captured rocky planet orbited Moryann in a retrograde orbit. In the end, it ended up like Triton in the solar system due to constant tidal forces. Close to Moryann, eventually leading to it becoming Moryann's ring.  In addition, it also has a huge and thin halo, which may have been formed tens of thousands of years ago when a large moon entered its Roche limit. We speculate that a rocky planet may have been captured during the inward migration of Moryann after its formation. This captured rocky planet orbited Moryann in a retrograde orbit. In the end, it ended up like Triton in the solar system due to constant tidal forces. Being close to Moryann eventually led to it becoming Moryann's ring.  As the captured retrograde planet continued to approach Moryann, its gravity continued to push its two large moons closer to Moryann, but in the end, because the two moons themselves were relatively far away from Moryann, they survived. Most of the remaining satellites were not spared from colliding with this retrograde object or falling into Moryann.   Now, this system is what we see : Moryann has two large satellites, one of which has a thick atmosphere and liquid water, which may be habitable.   Since it is still far away from the solar system, it is difficult for us to know the atmospheric composition of Moryann from a long distance. It was not until the "Survey" telescope we built at Muna L2 that we solved this problem. A research team composed of scientific researchers used the survey telescope's The mid-infrared instrument made this new discovery, which is the first time evidence of oxygen has been found in the atmosphere of a gaseous exoplanet.  So, how did we determine that its atmosphere contained oxygen from as far away as 2 light-years away? As seen from Muna, when an exoplanet passes in front of its central star, we can learn about the composition of the planet's atmosphere by studying the star's light that passes through it. If the atmosphere contains substances such as oxygen or methane, these substances will absorb light of specific wavelengths. Therefore, as long as you confirm at which wavelengths the light passing through the planet's atmosphere is absorbed, you can know whether the planet's atmosphere contains oxygen. Or methane. We've been waiting for years for this...
