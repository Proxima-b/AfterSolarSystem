        #ASS_Sun_name = The Sun
        #ASS_Sun_desc = The Sun is dying. The hydrogen in the center has already been burned out, leaving only the core composed of carbon and helium. Before that,it had ended the RGB phase. After the helium flash, it entered the horizontal branch and then the asymptotic giant branch; The last energy before death supported its shell and pushed its atmosphere to expand, making the sun more than 2800 times brighter than before and becoming a giant. Mercury and Venus have been swallowed up, and the earth will be the same fate as them in the future; At the same time, the mass of the sun is slowly decreasing, and the orbits of the surviving celestial bodies are gradually moving outward. Even so, the huge heat brought by the fusion energy still causes the surface temperature of any celestial body within the orbit of Uranus to rise to the extent that carbon based life cannot survive, while the light intensity in the orbit of distant Neptune is just right...

But before that it needs to withstand multiple helium flashes from the sun... In fact, billions of years ago, with the deterioration of the earth's environment, humans have already left the earth and went to the planets of the stars near the solar system to to colonize... With the passage of time, time gradually erased all traces of human existence... If time erased the traces of human existence, then the sun is erasing at this moment will be all matter on the entire surface of the earth...

Just like the solar eclipse in 2020 AD. However, due to the tidal force, the moon has been moving away from the earth. Gradually, the total solar eclipse cannot be seen...eventually, even the annular solar eclipse cannot be seen again. When the last annular solar eclipse appeared, no human beings on the surface of the earth could witness the occurrence of this annular solar eclipse...

There is no life on this planet at this time. But Mars was once the second home of mankind billions of years ago. It used to have two moons, Phobos and Deimos. But in the end, Phobos hit Mars, and the second moon of Mars, Deimos, gradually moved away from Mars, and finally entered the orbit of the sun. But now All traces left by human beings, together with the crust with a depth of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of meters, have been erased by a flame erupted by the sun.

        #ASS_Ceres_name = Ceres
        #ASS_Ceres_desc = Ceres is a dwarf planet in the middle main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It was the first asteroid discovered, on 1 January 1801, by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Sicily and announced as a new planet. Ceres was later classified as an asteroid and then a dwarf planet.         A human probe has reached this celestial body before, that is Dawn...  Dawn found Ceres's surface to be a mixture of water ice and hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. Gravity data suggest Ceres to be partially differentiated into a muddy (ice-rock) mantle/core and a less dense but stronger crust that is at most thirty percent ice by volume. Although Ceres likely lacks an internal ocean of liquid water, brines still flow through the outer mantle and reach the surface, allowing cryovolcanoes such as Ahuna Mons to form roughly every fifty million years. This makes Ceres the closest known cryovolcanic body to the Sun, and the brines provide a potential habitat for microbial life.  After the sun enters the end of the main sequence, the brightness of the sun continues to increase, which also causes the temperature of Ceres to increase, which causes the ice on its surface to slowly melt. In the end, it completely evaporates into space, leaving only a rocky core. But now this rock core has begun to melt

        #ASS_Hygia_name = Hygia
        #ASS_Hygia_desc = Hygiea (minor-planet designation: 10 Hygiea)is a major asteroid and possible dwarf planet located in the main asteroid belt.Orbiting at an average of 3.14 AU from the Sun, Hygiea is the most distant of the "big four" asteroids. It lies closer to the ecliptic as well, with an orbital inclination of 4°.Its orbit is less circular than those of Ceres or Vesta, with an eccentricity of around 0.12.Its perihelion is at a quite similar longitude to those of Vesta and Ceres, though its ascending and descending nodes are opposite to the corresponding ones for those objects. Although its perihelion is extremely close to the mean distance of Ceres and Pallas, a collision between Hygiea and its larger companions is impossible because at that distance they are always on opposite sides of the ecliptic. In 2056, Hygiea will pass 0.025 AU from Ceres, and then in 2063, Hygiea will pass 0.020 AU from Pallas. At aphelion Hygiea reaches out to the extreme edge of the asteroid belt at the perihelia of the Hilda family, which is in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. Hygiea has a large iron core.   As the brightness of the sun continues to increase, Hygiea's ice gradually melts, and finally flows into space, and now only a rocky core remains. Before long, this core will gradually melt, and finally only an iron-nickel core will remain.

        #ASS_Vesta_name = Vesta
        #ASS_Vesta_desc = Vesta(4 Vesta)  NASA's Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around Vesta from July 16, 2011 to September 5, 2012, conducted exploration for nearly a year, and then headed to Ceres. Pallas was discovered by Heinrich Obers in 1802, a year after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter to the British astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that more debris might be found near the intersection of the orbits of Ceres and Pallas. The intersection of these orbits is in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo.           Vesta is the second most massive asteroid in the main asteroid belt, but its mass is only 28% of Ceres. It is less dense than the four inner planets, but higher than most moons and other asteroids. Its surface area is approximately as large as Pakistan (approximately 800,000 square kilometers). Vesta's orbit lies inside the Kirkwood Gap of the asteroid belt, within 2.50 AU. It has a differentiated interior and is slightly smaller (within a margin of error) than Pallas, but about 25% more massive. The shape of Vesta is close to a gravity-relaxed ellipsoid, but there are huge depressions and protrusions at the south pole, coupled with a mass of less than 5 × 1020 kg, making it automatically excluded by Resolution 5 of the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union. Recognized as a dwarf planet. Recent shape analysis of Vesta  and gravity field data collected using the Dawn spacecraft indicate that Vesta has not yet reached hydrostatic equilibrium. As far as asteroids are concerned, its rotation is relatively fast (period 5.342 hours) and is prograde. The north pole points to right ascension 20h32min, declination +48° (in Cygnus), and there is an uncertainty of about 10° . The tilt angle of the rotation axis is 29°.  The surface temperature is estimated to be -20°C in the middle of the day; in winter, the temperature at the extremes is as low as -190°C. Normal day and night temperatures are -60°C and -130°C respectively. The above estimates were made on May 6, 1996, when Vesta was very close to perihelion. Details may vary slightly with the seasons. In the past, Vesta's maximum temperature could rise to -3 degrees Celsius. But now, as the sun's brightness continues to increase, its temperature has gradually risen to the point where rocks melt.

        #ASS_Jupiter_name = Jupiter
        #ASS_Jupiter_desc = After the sun entered the progressive giant stage, the landscape of the solar system as we know it changed drastically. One of the most significant changes occurred on the giant gas planet Jupiter. As the sun expands and increases in brightness, Jupiter's temperature soars to more than 470 degrees. This unprecedented high temperature completely changed the appearance and inner structure of Jupiter. One of Jupiter's defining features has long been the gorgeous ammonia clouds on its surface. However, under this extreme high temperature, those ammonia clouds completely evaporated and disappeared, turning Jupiter into a dark blue gaseous sphere. This deep, single blue contrasts sharply with Jupiter's colorful appearance in the past. Jupiter's atmosphere became extremely turbulent in this new environment. The wind speed in the atmosphere has reached an astonishing level, blowing hurricanes several times the speed of sound, which is unprecedented on other planets in the solar system. These violent storms rage through the deep blue atmosphere, creating a spectacular and terrifying sight. The satellite system around Jupiter has also been drastically affected. As temperatures continue to rise, the once-thick layers of ice on these moons evaporate, leaving exposed rocky cores. The most famous of these moons, Europa, was once known for its subsurface ocean. Now, those ice sheets and oceans are gone, replaced by a scorching rocky landscape that has turned Europa, and the entire Jupiter system, into a hot, barren place.

		#ASS_Saturn_name = Saturn
		#ASS_Saturn_desc = This planet, like Jupiter, is a Jupiter-like planet / gas giant planet. Its composition is similar to Jupiter. Its main component is hydrogen and has clouds composed of ammonia. After Saturn heats up, these ammonia clouds cannot exist at high temperatures. They have all evaporated, and there are still a small amount of clouds at the north and south poles of Saturn today. These clouds are mainly composed of water, because the temperature at the north and south poles of Saturn still does not exceed 100 degrees Celsius at this time. As a result, Saturn appears much brighter than Jupiter and much like Neptune billions of years ago. Saturn's once-remarkable features: Saturn's rings. Over the long years, fragments of the rings gradually fell into the atmosphere of Saturn. Eventually, this beautiful ring disappeared more than 6 billion years ago. When the sun enters the red giant stage, humans predict that Titan, the moon of the Saturn system, will be habitable for life in about one million years. Because the Huygens probe carried by Cassini had landed on Saturn's moon Titan when the previous Cassini probe went to Saturn. The data returned by the Huygens probe showed that Titan has a thick atmosphere and rivers and lakes on its surface...   But humans have overlooked one thing. When Titan's temperature rises to close to 0 degrees, its atmosphere will slowly escape, and the ice will also begin to slowly evaporate...                     Today, the temperature of the Saturn system has risen to nearly 200 degrees Celsius. At such high temperatures, all the ice on the satellites of this planetary system has evaporated. Titan, once known as the most Earth-like object in the solar system, is now a fiery inferno

        #ASS_Uranus_name = Uranus			
		#ASS_Uranus_desc = This ancient planet has a unique rotation axis. Compared with other planets, its rotation axis is very strange. It looks like it is lying on the ecliptic plane while rotating around the sun. It is the Uranus of our solar system. Uranus had been observed many times before it was recognized as a planet, but people regarded it as a star. The earliest record can be traced back to 1690, when John Flamsteed listed it as "34 Tauri" in the star catalogue, and observed it at least 6 times. French astronomer Pierre Lemonnier also observed at least 12 times between 1750 and 1769, including one observation that lasted four consecutive nights. On March 13, 1781, the British William Herschel observed the planet in the courtyard of his home at 19 New King Street (now the Herschel Astronomical Museum) in Bath, Somerset County, England, but In his earliest report on April 26, 1781, he called it a "comet." Herschel "made a series of parallax observations of the star" using a telescope of his own design. Herschel notified the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, of his discovery, and received an incoherent reply from Maskelyne on 23 April: "I don't know what to call her. He is approaching." It moves in a circular orbit much like a planet, whereas a comet moves in a very flat elliptical orbit. I also saw no coma or tail." While Herschel continued to cautiously describe his new objects as comets, other astronomers had begun to cast different doubts. Russian astronomer Anders Johan Lexell estimated that he was 18 times farther from the Sun than the Earth, and no comet had ever been observed at perihelion beyond four times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. . Berlin astronomer Johann Bode described Herschel's discovery as if "stars moving in circular orbits beyond the orbit of Saturn may be regarded as hitherto unknown planet-like objects." Bode concluded that the circular object was more like a planet than a comet. This object was quickly accepted as a planet. In 1783, French scientist Laplace confirmed that what Herschel discovered was a planet. Herschel himself admitted this fact to Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Astronomical Society: "Observations by the most eminent astronomers of Europe revealed that this new star, which I had the honor of identifying in March 1781, It is one of the major planets in the solar system."  Uranus's rotation axis can be said to lie on the orbital plane, tilted at an angle of up to 97.77275°, which makes its seasonal changes completely different from other planets. The rotation axes of the other planets are all pointing upward relative to the orbital plane of the solar system. Uranus's rotation is like the tipping and rolling of a ball. When Uranus is near the solstice, one pole will continue to point toward the Sun and the other pole will point away from the Sun. Only in a narrow area near the equator can you experience the rapid alternation of day and night, but the position of the sun is very low, just like in the polar regions of the earth. When traveling to the other side of the orbit, the other pole of the axis points to the sun;           After the Sun entered the main sequence and became a red giant, the temperature of Uranus also rose to above 0 degrees Celsius. Thanks to its unusual tilt, the temperatures at Uranus' poles are sometimes even higher than the average temperature of Saturn! The methane (CH4) in Uranus's atmosphere will evaporate rapidly at such high temperatures. The absorption bands of this methane in the visible and near-infrared once gave Uranus its obvious blue-green or cyan color. But now they have disappeared. They were replaced by clouds made of water, which also caused Uranus' color to change from cyan in the past to gray-white today. This also results in its high reflectivity, which makes it easy to observe this object from Muna. In addition, because the angle of Uranus's rotation axis is so large, this also causes the orbital inclination of its satellites to be as large as Uranus. This also causes the ice on the surface of the moons in this system to evaporate unusually quickly. Sometimes the surfaces of these moons are so hot that the rocks melt.

		#ASS_Muna_desc = Muna is the only habitable object in the solar system. Billions of years ago, Muna orbited a red dwarf star much smaller than the sun. But when the star system moved to a position about 800AU away from the solar system, Muna was affected by the gravity of the sun and broke away from the original orbit around the red dwarf.              It begins to approach the solar system along the ecliptic and approaches Sun.  At the same time, after the environmental transformation, Muna's plants produced enough oxygen to make Muna's atmosphere available for human respiration. At this time, the sun has entered the asymptotic giant branch.              Under the light of the sun at the beginning of AGB, the temperature of Muna is low, and the average surface temperature is only about 2 to 3 degrees Celsius. Huge ice sheets cover the poles of the planet. If you live on this celestial body, you may need to wear thick clothes to go outdoors, otherwise you are likely to suffer from frostbite or hypothermia; Especially at night, its temperature will drop to nearly zero degrees Celsius. The sun is still expanding, and its luminosity continues to rise. At the same time, it ejects gas from the outer shell. and also, it is possible that helium flashes may occur repeatedly, thus destroying the surviving celestial bodies. After that, the sun will become a white dwarf, making the sidereal system a dead ruin. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare to leave this system as soon as possible to find new home, which is the only......

    	#ASS_Moll_name = Moll
		#ASS_Moll_desc = Moll is the largest natural satellite of Muna. Its mass is about 1/119 of Muna. It is the largest satellite in terms of volume and mass relative to the planet it orbits. It is generally believed that Moll and Muna formed at the same time in the original red dwarf star system about 10 billion years ago. Its rotation is synchronized with its revolution (tidally locked), so the same side faces Muna. If you observe it through a telescope, you will find that its surface is covered with dense craters. Moll is the third largest celestial body when viewed from Muna, and although it appears very bright, its surface is actually very dark. But you can still observe this object with the naked eye from the surface of Muna. Its density is very low, only about 3.01 grams per cubic centimeter. Based on this density we can infer that it does not have an iron-nickel core similar to Muna.   Moll is the farthest satellite from Muna. It takes about 55 days to orbit Muna, so you will find that its moon phases change very slowly.

		#ASS_Faun_desc = Faun is the second largest natural satellite of Muna. with a mass of about 1/323 of Muna. It is the satellite with the largest apparent diameter on Muna. Likewise, its rotation is synchronized with its revolution (tidally locked), so the same side faces Muna. As you can see from Muna, it is gray in color. These gray materials may be basalt, so we speculate that it has experienced a volcanic eruption or a violent impact. The impact caused lava to cover most of the surface of the celestial body. Although it is gray, its reflectivity is still not low. When Faun was full moon, Ning could still see the words on the book clearly under the moonlight. Its density is slightly greater than Moll, about 3.04 grams per cubic centimeter. Likewise, this also means that there is no iron-nickel core. Moll is the second-farthest satellite from Muna and takes about 15 days to orbit Muna. Although it is very close to Muna, it is only one-third of the mass of the Earth's satellite, the Moon, so its gravitational influence on Muna's tides is minimal. It's not even as big as the ocean tidal changes caused by Moll.

Mann is also Muna's second-largest visible satellite. Its mass is approximately 1/36239 of Muna. Roughly spherical, slightly flattened at the poles. There are several large craters on the surface. Its rotation is synchronized with its revolution (tidally locked), so the same side faces Muna. It is close to white in color and has high reflectivity. You can easily observe this oblate spheroid satellite with the naked eye on Muna. It is the closest to Muna, and it only takes 2 days to circle Muna. Therefore, you can notice that Muna's moon phases are changing rapidly every night. Because its mass is still too small, it still cannot have a significant tidal impact on Muna's ocean. The resulting sea surface undulations are not even as high as the waves caused by the Muna offshore wind.

Its equatorial radius is about 70km and its mass is about 1/26367168 of Muna. The shape is elongated. Its rotation is synchronized with its revolution (tidally locked), so the same side faces Muna. The area facing Muna is very small (the surface of the polar radius). Therefore, it is very difficult to observe it from Muna. Its dark yellow color is distinctive from all the satellites in the system. At the same time, its reflectivity is relatively low, which means that even if you use a telescope to observe it in Muna, it is difficult to observe its clear surface. Because it has low reflectivity and a small observable area.  It is also unique in this system in another aspect, that is, density. Its density ratio is the largest in this system, and its density reaches approximately 5.54 grams per cubic centimeter. This means it is mostly made of metal. Therefore it is also known as the "space gem"

        #ASS_Neptune_name = Neptune
		#ASS_Neptune_desc = The planet once had many more moons, but now almost all of them have disappeared, leaving only two unusually distant moons. Today, when we use telescopes to observe this planet, we will find that it has a larger and brighter ring than the rings of Saturn before. This planet is Neptune. It's all thanks to Neptune's largest moon - Triton. Triton is the largest natural satellite of Neptune and the earliest satellite of Neptune observed by humans. It was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell on October 10, 1846. Triton is the only large moon in the solar system with a retrograde orbit, which is the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. Because of its retrograde orbit and similar composition and structure to Pluto, Triton is generally believed to be a dwarf planet captured from the Kuiper Belt. This theory could explain a series of unusual aspects of Neptune's moon system. Because Triton is already orbiting very close to Neptune, and due to its retrograde orbit, it continues to be affected by tidal effects. It has been approaching Neptune for billions of years. In the process of continuous approach, it destroyed the so-called satellites of Neptune along the way. Eventually it entered Neptune's Roche limit, and Neptune's huge tidal forces tore Triton into pieces, which eventually formed the rings we see today. At one time Neptune's rings were much larger than they are today. But over time, fragments of the rings continued to fall into Neptune's atmosphere... resulting in what we see today. In about another billion years, this halo will completely disappear.  At the same time, the sun has also entered the end of the main sequence, and the energy it releases is nearly 1,200 times greater than that of the main sequence. The huge heat causes Neptune's temperature to rise to nearly -20 degrees. The methane in Neptune's atmosphere will evaporate. At this same temperature, Neptune begins to form water clouds. This will completely change the color of Neptune. Makes it look almost white. This also results in Neptune's reflectivity being very high, reaching an astonishing 0.85! You can easily see the planet by raising your head at the right time.

        #ASS_Pluto_name = Pluto
		#ASS_Pluto_desc = Pluto (134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans -Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has only one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one third its volume. Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. , because the center of gravity of their orbits is not in any one celestial body, and they are tidally locked. The New Horizons mission, the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015, and made detailed measurements and observations. Discovered in 1930 AD, Pluto was the first object in the Kuiper Belt. It was immediately hailed as Planet Nine, but it was always a strange object whose planetary status was called into question when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These doubts grew as more objects in the Kuiper Belt began to be discovered in the 1990s, notably the more massive scattered disk Eris discovered in 2005. In 2006 AD, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially redefined the term "planet" to exclude dwarf planets such as dwarf planets. However, many planetary astronomers still consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets. Once Pluto was found, its faintness and lack of a viewable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century. Its orbital characteristics are very different from those of planets, which orbit the sun in nearly circular orbits close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical) relative to the ecliptic. Although Pluto's orbit appears to intersect that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the orbits of the two objects do not intersect. Perturbations from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years, making collisions possible. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: Pluto orbits the Sun twice, and Neptune orbits the Sun three times. This orbital resonance keeps Pluto stable over billions of years.        Once, Pluto was very cold, and more than 98% of the plain on the surface was composed of solid nitrogen and ice, and also contained trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. After the sun entered the red giant stage, its temperature began to heat up, and the solid nitrogen on the surface of Pluto began to melt and enter Pluto's atmosphere. Pluto's original thin atmosphere began to thicken slowly. Subsequently, the temperature in parts of Pluto rose to above zero degrees Celsius. The ice in these areas began to melt, forming lakes. The originally cold and dead world began to slowly rejuvenate...

Because Eris appears larger than Pluto, NASA originally described it as the tenth planet in the solar system. This, and the prospect of finding other objects of similar size in the future, prompted the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" for the first time. Eris, Pluto, and Ceres are all "dwarf planets" according to the International Astronomical Union's definition approved on August 24, 2006, reducing the number of known planets in the solar system to eight. The same number as before the discovery of Pluto in 1930 AD. Observations of the stellar occultation Eris in 2010 indicated that it was slightly smaller than Pluto, with an average diameter of 2,377 ± 4 km (1,477 ± 2 miles) as measured by New Horizons in July 2015 CE.        Now, the brightness of the sun is a thousand times brighter than before, causing the temperature of Eris to rise to minus 56 degrees Celsius. After artificial modification of Eris' atmosphere and increasing the concentration of the atmosphere to make it have a greenhouse effect, the temperature of Eris has It has reached the conditions for life to survive.

        #ASS_Sedna_name = Sedna
		#ASS_Sedna_desc = Sedna is a dwarf planet located in the outermost layer of the solar system, which is a member of the Scattered disc celestial body. Scattered discs are a group of objects that are pulled into highly elongated orbits by the gravity of Neptune. At one time, however, some astronomers questioned this classification because its perihelion is too large to be scattered by any known planets. This has led some astronomers to informally refer to it as the first known member of the Neoort Cloud. It was later known that Sedna was influenced by another planet beyond the orbit of Neptune, Telisto, an ice giant about 6 times the mass of Earth.                                                                                  Sedna (2003 VB12) was discovered by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on 14 November 2003. The discovery formed part of a survey began in 2001 with the Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California, using Yale's 160-megapixel Palomar Quest camera. On that day, an object was observed to move by 4.6 arcseconds over 3.1 hours relative to stars, which indicated that its distance was about 1 00 AU. Follow- up observations were made in November–December 2003 with the SMARTS (Small and Medium Research Telescope System) at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the Tenagra IV telescope in Nogales, Arizona, and the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Combined with recovery observations taken at the Samuel Oschin telescope in August 2003, and by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking consortium in 2001–2002, these observations allowed accurate determination of its orbit. The calculations showed that the object was m oving along a distant highly eccentric orbit . Telescopic observations show that in visible light, Sedna is one of the reddest objects in the solar system, almost as red as Mars. These red substances may be methane, hydrocarbon sludge or tholin. Since Sedna has been in a distant orbit for a long time, the temperature there is not higher than -240 degrees all the year round, and these substances exist on the surface of Sedna in the form of solid. After the sun entered the red giant stage, the temperature of Sedna rose to -141 degrees. This material began to slowly melt, creating a very thin atmosphere.

        #ASS_PlanetNine_name = Telisto
		#ASS_PlanetNine_desc = ( Planet Nine / Telisto / Proserpine / Kore / Allecto / Megaera / Tisiphone )   This is the ninth planet in our solar system. It is the planet that took the longest time for us humans to discover. It took 182 years to discover it after the last discovery of Neptune. For tens of billions of years, it has been lurking in the Kuiper Belt in the solar system. Because it is too far away from the sun, it moves very slowly in the sky, and when viewed from the earth, it almost always lies in front of a star cluster. Therefore, human telescopes mistook it for a star. The planet was first suggested as a possibility in 1846. Following the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The best-known of these theories predicted the existence of a distant planet that was influencing the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. After extensive calculations Percival Lowell predicted the possible orbit and location of the hypothetical trans-Neptunian planet and began an extensive search for it in 1906. He called the hypothetical object Planet X, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. Clyde Tombaugh continued Lowell's search and in 1930 discovered Pluto, but it was soon determined to be too small to qualify as Lowell's Planet Nine. After Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune in 1989, the difference between Uranus' predicted and observed orbit was determined to have been due to the use of a previously inaccurate mass of Neptune. Attempts to detect planets beyond Neptune by indirect means such as orbital perturbation date back to before the discovery of Pluto. Among the first was George Forbes who postulated the existence of two trans-Neptunian planets in 1880. One would have an average distance from the Sun , or semi-major axis, of 100 astronomical units (AU), 100 times that of the Earth. The second would have a semi-major axis of 300 AU. His work is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories in that the planets would be responsible for a clustering of the orbits of several objects, in this case the clustering of aphelion distances of periodic comets near 100 and 300 AU. This is similar to how the aphelion distances of Jupiter-family comets cluster near its orbit.The discovery of Sedna's peculiar orbit in 2004 led to speculation that it had encountered a massive body other than one of the known planets. Sedna's orbit is detached, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU that is too large to be due to gravitational interactions with Neptune . Several authors proposed that Sedna entered this orbit after encountering a massive body such as an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a member of the open cluster that formed with the Sun, or another star that later passed near the Solar System.The announcement in March 2014 of the discovery of a second sednoid with a perihelion distance of 80 AU, 2012 VP113, in a similar orbit led to renewed speculation that an unknown super-Earth remained in the distant Solar System. At a conference in 2012, Rodney Gomes proposed that an undetected planet was responsible for the orbits of some ETNOs with detached orbits and the large semi-major axis Centaurs, small Solar System bodies that cross the orbits of the giant planets.The proposed Neptune- massed planet would be in a distant (1500 AU), eccentric (eccentricity 0.4), and inclined (inclination 40°) orbit. Like Planet Nine it would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU to oscillate, delivering some into planet-crossing orbits and others into detached orbits like that of Sedna. An article by Gomes, Soares, and Brasser was published in 2015, detailing their arguments. In 2014, astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott S. Sheppard noted the similarities in the orbits of Sedna and 2012 VP113 and several other ETNOs. They proposed that an unknown planet in a circular orbit between 200 and 300 AU was perturbing their orbits. Later that year , Raúl and Carlos de la Fuente Marcos argued that two massive planets in orbital resonance were necessary to produce the similarities of so many orbits, 13 known at the time. Using a larger sample of 39 ETNOs, they estimated that the nearer planet had a semi -major axis in the range of 300–400 AU, a relatively low eccentricity, and an inclination of nearly 14 degrees. Later, people compared previous images and discovered that the "point" in the sky had moved decades ago, and finally discovered that it was a celestial body orbiting the sun. This confirmed that it was the ninth planet we were looking for. Later, people compared previous images and discovered that the "point" in the sky had moved decades ago, and finally discovered that it was a celestial body orbiting the sun. This confirmed that it was the ninth planet we were looking for.  In the past, it has been lurking in the dark areas at the edge of the solar system for a long time. We initially only speculated on the possibility of its existence from those trans-Neptunian objects with abnormal orbits. In the past, we were unable to observe this planet with any telescope because it was so far away that even the most powerful telescopes would not be able to detect it because it would be obscured by the light of background stars.    Even the probe can't get there before it runs out of power, so we still know very little about this planet. Now, after the sun enters the red giant stage, the brightness of the sun is thousands of times greater than before. The brightness of the planet is now close to that of Pluto in the past...     We can already see it using the Survey Telescope at Muna's Lagrange L2 point. Although we had already arrived in a spacecraft before and viewed the planet up close.   This is a blue planet. The blue color of this planet is different from that of Jupiter today. Its blue color is due to the presence of trace amounts of methane in the atmosphere at high altitudes in Planet Nine's atmosphere. The main absorption bands appear in the red and infrared spectral positions of wavelengths above 600 nanometers. This gives Planet Nine a bluish hue, similar to that of Neptune 8 billion years ago. At the same time, it has a huge star ring. The material in this ring is mainly composed of ice. However, due to the distance, the brightness of the sun is too low, and even materials with high reflectivity appear very dim.                    The mass of the sun is slowly losing. Soon, the sun's gravity will no longer be able to bind this planet far away in the Oort cloud. By then, it will become an interstellar planet.

It was first observed on October 13, 2015 AD by astronomers at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. The object was informally known as "The Leprechaun" by its discoverer, who later named it Leleākūhonua, based on its discovery date close to Halloween and the letters in its provisional designation "2015 TG387", matching its orbit with the flight of the Pacific Golden Plover Comparison. This is the third sednoid discovered after Sedna and 2012 VP113, with a diameter of about 220 kilometers. For years, scientists have been trying to figure out why these objects have such high aphels. Until finally, they discovered the ninth planet Telisto very far away from the sun... The discovery of this planet provided a reasonable explanation for the celestial bodies running in abnormal orbits in the outer reaches of the solar system. Today, the sun is slowly losing its mass, and its orbit will become higher and higher. Soon, it will break away from the sun's gravity and enter interstellar space...

This is a sphere composed of hot plasma, but it is not a perfect sphere. Due to the extremely high rotation speed, its shape is an ellipsoid with a significant bulge at the equator. Heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. Moryan radiates energy mainly in the form of visible light, ultraviolet and infrared rays, and is the most important energy source for life on earth. Moryan's radius is approximately 813,600 kilometers (polar radius). Its mass is approximately 2.35E+10 kg. Moryan is an F-type main sequence star (F9V) whose light is actually white and is therefore informally, and not entirely accurately, called a yellow-white dwarf. It was formed approximately 0.45 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within the macromolecular cloud region. Most of the matter is concentrated in the center, while the rest is flattened into an orbital disk, evolving into the Moryan System. The central mass becomes so hot and dense that it eventually initiates nuclear fusion in its core. In the core of this star, approximately hundreds of millions of tons of hydrogen are fused into helium every second, converting 5 million tons of matter into energy in the process. This energy may take 10,000 to 170,000 years to escape the core and is the source of Moryan's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core is reduced to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will experience a significant increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, ultimately transforming Moryan into a red giant star, as seen in our night sky today The brightest star seen in - Like the Sun, that star is 0.8 light years away from us. It was once a G2V star, about 10 billion years old, and about 18% less massive than our Moryan. When it reached the end of its life After it came to an end, it expanded rapidly, swallowing up the two planets in their star system, and became 2,000 times brighter than before. Quality is also lost by almost 20%. That bright star is the brightest star in our night sky and what our parent star will look like in the future.
