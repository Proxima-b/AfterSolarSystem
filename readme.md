# _****Introduce****_
After Solar System is a mod that simulates a future world: After about 7.9 billion years, the Sun's life will come to an end. When it expands into a red giant, its volume will be more than 200 times larger than that of the main sequence star stage, and objects that are closer to it will not be able to survive. It has engulfed Mercury and Venus. At this time, the Earth are dying, and the huge heat release by the red giant raises the temperature of the Earth to nearly 2,000 degrees Celsius. The 4 gas giants in the solar system have also undergone great changes after the Sun becames a red giant. At the same time, before the Sun becames a red giant, a red dwarf passes through the solar system 800 AU away from the Sun, which will make the Sun to capture a new planet.

Our Milky Way will also merge with the Andromeda Galaxy in a collision to form a larger galaxy. At that time, the Sun has reached the end of its red giant stage, about to enter the asymptotic giant branch, and then destroy the surviving objects in repeated helium flashes. The Sun will then become a white dwarf, leaving this star system a dead ruin. It has become more and more unstable lately, and could erupt at any time. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare to leave this star system as soon as possible and seek for new terrestrial planets, which is the only way out, for humankind.

### _***AfterSolarSystem is compatible with (or provides support for) the following mods:***_
- [Environmental Visual Enhancements](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases)
- [Scatterer](https://spacedock.info/mod/141/Scatterer)
- [Distant Object Enhancement](https://spacedock.info/mod/2274/Distant%20Object%20Enhancement%20Continued)

- [TUFX](https://github.com/shadowmage45/TUFX/releases)
- [KS3P](https://github.com/c1usta/KS3P/releases)
### _***AfterSolarSystem is not compatible with the following mods:***_
- External visual mods (RVE,RSSVE,EVO,...)
- External planet mods (RSS,AfterKerbin,BeyondHome，...)

### _***Recommended mods to install:***_

- [Better Time Warp](https://spacedock.info/mod/1162/BetterTimeWarpContinued)
*** 
_"After Solar System Mod" theoretically does not have very high performance requirements (in the case of only using Scatterer as a visual module), I can run relatively smoothly on a 2015 notebook of my grandmother, and the configuration of this notebook is I3-5005U 10GB DDR3 memory and Intel's core graphics card, 1TB mechanical hard disk. This may be the minimum requirement to ensure the visual situation as much as possible_
***Therefore my recommendation is:***
- Your processor needs to have at least 4 cores and 8 threads.
- RAM at least equal to or greater than 10GB
- It is best to use a graphics card with 2G or higher video memory

# ***Author's Words：***
I am a senior middle school student who is new to KSP Mod production. I don't have much time to complete the production. Basically, I only have time to continue the production of AfterSolarSystem on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays. Of course, it is not ruled out that I will play other games on weekends. This AfterSolarSystem mod actually started in 2020, but then I gave up and the plan was shelved. But in September 2022, I decided to start making again... 

**Finally, I wish you a happy game**
