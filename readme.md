# _****Introduce****_
_After Solar System, you can also call it Future Solar System. This mod simulates the scenario of the solar system 7.9 billion years after according to the prediction_ _under the current situation of our solar system:_ 

_The sun stays in the main sequence stage for about 10 billion years. After 10 billion years, the sun will leave the main sequence stage. It will expand into a red giant, devouring the objects close to it, such as Mercury and Venus. Then the sun will enter helium flash phase, which makes the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus lose all their ice. At the same time, the mass of the sun is also slowly decreasing in the substance ejections. At that time, the orbits of all surviving celestial bodies will move outward. But even so, the heat from the sun will make the temperature of Uranus rise to tens of degrees Celsius above zero. Meanwhile, life can only survive under the proper level of light and heat, where it is very far away from the sun._

_The sun in this mod is in the initial AGB (Asymptotic Giant Branch) phase. Let's put aside the mod, the sun will become more and more unstable in the future, and may erupt again at any time. It will destroy all the surviving celestial bodies in successive eruptions and turn the system into a ruin. Finally, the sun will end its AGB phase that lasted only 800 thousand years and become a white dwarf, making the solar system a dead silence._

*** 
_"After Solar System Mod" theoretically does not have very high performance requirements (in the case of only using Scatterer as a visual module), I can run relatively smoothly on a 2015 notebook of my grandmother, and the configuration of this notebook is I3-5005U 10GB DDR3 memory and Intel's core graphics card, 1TB mechanical hard disk. This may be the minimum requirement to ensure the visual situation as much as possible_
***Therefore my recommendation is:***
- Your processor needs to have at least 4 cores and 8 threads.
- RAM at least equal to or greater than 10GB
- It is best to use a graphics card with 2G or higher video memory

# ***Author's Words：***
I am a senior middle school student who is new to KSP Mod production. I don't have much time to complete the production. Basically, I only have time to continue the production of AfterSolarSystem on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays. Of course, it is not ruled out that I will play other games on weekends. This AfterSolarSystem mod actually started in 2020, but then I gave up and the plan was shelved. But in September 2022, I decided to start making again...

**Finally, I wish you a happy game**
