# ***Introduce***

## ***Story Background：***
After Solar System is a mod that simulates a future world: After about 5 billion years, the sun's life will come to an end, when it expands into a red giant star, its volume will expand to more than 200 times larger than the main sequence star stage , objects that are closer to the sun will not be able to survive. It has engulfed Mercury and Venus in the solar system. At this time, the earth was dying, and the huge heat released by the red giant star raised the temperature of the earth to nearly 2,000 degrees Celsius. 
The 4 gas giant planets in the solar system have also undergone great changes after the sun became a red giant. At the same time, before the sun became a red giant, a red dwarf passed through the solar system from 800 AU, which made the sun acquire a new planet. 

Our Milky Way also merged with the Andromeda Galaxy in a collision to form a larger galaxy.
At the same time, The Sun has reached the end of the red giant, about to enter the asymptotic giant branch, and then destroy the surviving objects in repeated helium flashes. The Sun will then become a white dwarf, making the star system a dead ruin. It has become more and more unstable lately, and could erupt at any time. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare to leave this star system as soon as possible and look for new terrestrial planets, which is the only way out.

# ***Author's Words：***

I'm still a student, and I just learned how to make mods not long ago, and I don't have much time left to make them, but I'll still try to perfect After Solar System in the remaining time.
And about the copyright, it's ok, you can change it as you like, but please don't forget me because I need to leave something here. I hope some other author someday in the future can make After Solar System even better.

**Finally, I wish you a happy game**
