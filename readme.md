## introduce
The background of the story of After Solar System Mod is the world 5 billion years in the future, that is,
the solar system after the sun becomes a red giant star. In this mod, the sun becomes a red giant star,
engulfing Mercury and Venus, at which time humans have settled on a celestial body on the edge of the solar system,
albeit a very cold one...
