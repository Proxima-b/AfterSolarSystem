AAfter Solar System is a mod that simulates a future world: After about 5 billion years, the Sun's life will come to an end. When it expands into a red giant, its volume will be more than 200 times larger than that of the main sequence star stage, and objects that are closer to it will not be able to survive. It has engulfed Mercury and Venus. At this time, the Earth are dying, and the huge heat release by the red giant raises the temperature of the Earth to nearly 2,000 degrees Celsius. The 4 gas giants in the solar system have also undergone great changes after the Sun becames a red giant. At the same time, before the Sun becames a red giant, a red dwarf passes through the solar system 800 AU away from the Sun, which will make the Sun to capture a new planet.

Our Milky Way will also merge with the Andromeda Galaxy in a collision to form a larger galaxy. At that time, the Sun has reached the end of its red giant stage, about to enter the asymptotic giant branch, and then destroy the surviving objects in repeated helium flashes. The Sun will then become a white dwarf, leaving this star system a dead ruin. It has become more and more unstable lately, and could erupt at any time. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare to leave this star system as soon as possible and seek for new terrestrial planets, which is the only way out, for humankind.

# ***Author's Words：***

I'm still a student, and I just learned how to make mods not long ago, and I don't have much time left to make them, but I'll still try to perfect After Solar System in the remaining time.
And about the copyright, it's ok, you can change it as you like, but please don't forget me because I need to leave something here. I hope some other author someday in the future can make After Solar System even better.

**Finally, I wish you a happy game**
